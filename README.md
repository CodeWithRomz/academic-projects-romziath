## ðŸŸ¦ Java Projects

### ðŸ”¹ Metallurgical Factory Simulation â€“ Java
Built a turn-based factory simulation game using object-oriented principles.
Implemented product transformation logic, exception handling, and unit testing with JUnit.

### ðŸ”¹ Tibetan Transliteration System â€“ Java
Designed a console application that reads Tibetan UTF-16 text and produces two romanizations: Wylie and THL.
Handled file input/output, syllable parsing, role assignment (prefix, root, suffix, vowel), and applied a full transformation pipeline.
Focused on Unicode handling, algorithmic role detection, and output file formatting.

### ðŸ”¹ Doubly Linked List Algorithms â€“ Java
Implemented advanced list algorithms using generics and Predicate<T>.
Supported filtering, subset matching, division of list contents, and verification using JUnit.

## ðŸŸ© RISC-V Assembly Projects

### ðŸ”¹ HydroUQAM Dam Controller â€“ RISC-V
Developed an interactive dam controller that adjusts the opening of 8 gates based on user input.
Ensured safe water flow with dynamic checks for minimum (20%) and critical thresholds (80%).
Used hexadecimal display, conditional branching, and structured state tracking via registers.
Designed to pass automated test cases with initial states like 0x00000000 and 0xFFFFFFFF.

### ðŸ”¹ Word Dictionary Builder â€“ RISC-V
Parsed a text file to extract and sort unique words, tracking frequency, position, and length.
Used binary search for insertion, manual memory management, and modular low-level routines.

### ðŸ”¹ Fibonacci Calculator â€“ RISC-V
Implemented four Fibonacci algorithms: iterative, recursive, memoization with array, and memoization with BST.
Measured performance by counting instructions, and displayed internal memory structures.

## ðŸŸ¨ Software Engineering Projects â€“ INF2050

### ðŸ”¹ Halma Game Engine â€“ Java
Developed a full board game engine for Halma using MVC architecture across multiple deliverables.
Implemented move logic, AI decision-making (MadMax), unit testing (JUnit), and code quality tools (JaCoCo, Checkstyle).
Used Maven, Git, and Docker for build automation and continuous integration.
